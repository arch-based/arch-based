```Arch Linux is Based```
# About Me:


1. Who are you?
  - Hi, I am one of the users of Arch Linux.
2. Why do you like Arch Linux?  
  - I like Arch Linux because of its customizability.
3. What is my Desktop Environment/Window Manager?
  - I use Hyprland.
4. How did you install Arch Linux?
  - I installed arch linux manually. But in my opinion, you can use the archinstall script if you like it..
5. Why did you make this account?
 - I made this account to provide cool scripts I made or I found from the deepest layers of the web. But if I find the user I can credit the user who made the script. Sometimes I make my own scripts or code like the fetcher script that's way faster then most. :)

" Hope that cleared out 5 questions you had. If you have more questions tell me in my email: anonyneon4@gmail.com. I am new to github so do not mind if this doesn't have that much formatting. I am an advanced terminal user that uses Helix as it is written in rust, Hyprland w/ Waybar, and kitty as the terminal. I also use an Encrypted Root Partition, _a Home Subvolume that is encrypted with systemd-homed_ (not anymore, it has some issues), Unified Kernel Images ( UKI ), and Secure Boot. I made the fetcher-based package in the A.U.R please consider supporting my A.U.R package by doing this command and installing it: "

Check out my new project: [arch-based/sfetch](https://github.com/arch-based/sfetch) Use the good ol' way of installing suckless utilities, use make, so it can be used on different types of distribution:
Clone the repository:
```
# Installing
$ git clone https://github.com/arch-based/sfetch
$ cd sfetch
$ sudo make clean install
# Uninstalling
$ sudo make clean uninstall
```
